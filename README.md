	104、最长久的情，是平淡中的不离不弃。最贴心的暖，是风雨中的相依相伴。
　　《读书》上有梁小民先生写的《名校的美丽心灵》，便想到了这个题目。也许你会说，小学校也有风景吗？当然有的。她虽然没有大学那种名校硕师的气宇轩昂和悠然深长的历史，小学校亦会发出空谷幽兰的馥郁之气，透出小的宁静、祥和、美好。　　我的读书生涯，大抵都在小学校度过。小学生在本村读的，那是清同治年间修成的一座庙宇，雕梁画栋，镂花门窗，颇有些历史，解放后改做了本村的小学。许多年后的一个夏日黄昏，雨燕将长空嘶叫得有些凄凉，在那块圻颓的石碑上，我知道了这所毫不起眼的小学校的历史，但在这之前我们是不知道的。那么大一个深深庭院，土头土脑的房屋，土哩巴几的院墙，斑驳破旧，一放学便静悄悄的，阒静无声。一树雪梨花在南墙下开得凄伤绝艳，很有些孤芳自赏的味道。一位姓白的老师就住在雪梨树旁的土屋里，记得那时候他的头发已经花白，高高的个子，戴一副宽边颇显厚重的眼镜，人看起来就更显得土气。白老师为人和气，孩子们并不怕他。关于这点有一则小故事，我们村有个淘气的孩子，专爱翻墙上树，打枣摘杏。有一天他看到校园里那颗山楂树果满枝头，红艳艳的，便翻墙偷摘。待胡啃乱嚼一气之后，又呼朋唤友的叫远处的同伴：“白老师没在。”恰逢白老师走出屋门，就应了一句：“谁说我没在？”淘气包吓得屁滚尿流，连滚带爬地溜下树，白老师却问摔着没有，这孩子由此便改掉了偷鸡摸狗的毛病。多年后，当我也成为一名教师，在回乡的路上，我经常看到白老师的身影，老人赶着几只羊在放牧。为什么会这样，我没有勇气去问，甚至连打声招呼的勇气也没有，只感到满心凄凉。　　除了白老师因家远而住在学校外，别的老师大都是我们的同姓，这很让我们为难，不知该叫他们叔哥还是老师。譬如我的亲叔叔就在学校，但他却对我们姐弟几个格外严厉。二年级升级的时候，本来我的考试成绩都在七八十分，但班主任张老师却没有在我的家长通知书上签字，这事让我担心了一个假期。在分数决定一切的今天，我还没有听说哪个学生分数高而因淘气捣蛋被留级，但我们那时候是有的，人们把一个人的品质看得也很重要。从讲素质教育的今天看来，他们那样做无疑是对的。在那个较为闭塞和落后的小学校里，乡村孩子的倔强和偏狭的自尊使我们在小小年纪就对女孩子从心底里保持着一种敌意，没有哪个人敢对一个女孩子有好感。我的一个身高马大的侄女就曾在教室里揍过我一回，但我并没有因此而受到其他同伴的嘲讽。在我们的眼里，真正令人羞辱的事是和女同学来往。当然我们也经常搞些恶作剧，欺侮女同学。就因为这个，那个假期我忐忑不安，我的父亲却并不在意，男孩子嘛。开学后，在我再三承认错误后，我终于升了级。　　其实在我还没有上学的时候，我已经是小学校的常客了。这一则因为我的叔叔在学校教书，二则我的姐姐也在学校读书，还因为学校离我家很近。我和弟弟整日徜徉在校园里，嬉戏于林荫下，在这里，我们受到了最好的启蒙教育。朗朗的读书声飞绕我们的耳际，等到我们真正读书时，我们能背过的诗词小文章和能演算的数学题已经很多了。说真的，我并不是一个很聪慧的人，但这里美好的氛围给了我以后极大的鼓励，使我一想到它就无法停下学习，使我持之以恒一直读到大学。　　隐约记得小学校曾经作为一个公祭的灵堂，那时候白花绕门，哭声震动。那是个让人一生难忘的日子，当毛主席逝世的消息传到我们村后，全村人就在小学校南院的戏台上祭奠他，我们村人聚在一起，臂缠黑纱，默默致哀。我的一个婶婶哭得伤心凄惨。我从未见一个人会为一个外姓旁人哭的那样伤绝，而我们村的人就以这样朴素的方式送走了我们伟大的领袖，我想，毛主席它确实活在了普通民众的心里。　　大概是偷杏吃时毁坏了树枝吧；抑或爬柱弄坏了那雕花的画栋。总之，我很快告别了小学，到另一所初中学校读书，那也是一所小学校，印象最深的是它有一段残破的古城墙。黄昏时分，夕阳如血，雨燕翻飞，我们坐在高高的城墙上，任风掀起我们的头发、衣襟，把我们的激动和张扬带到更远更远。那一刻，我忽然感到小学校的宁静、凄美，她们朴实无华，不事张扬，却包容了那么多孩子美好的梦想。　　是的，每个孩子心中都有一所小学校，它是他们梦开始的地方。

104, the longest affection, is insipid in.
The most intimate of warm, is stay together in the wind and rain.
On "reading" written by Mr Liang xiaomin "school of a beautiful mind", and thought about the subject.
Maybe you would say that primary school also has a landscape?
Of course there is.
Though she is not university the school teacher to recognize the eaves and carefree deep-drawn history, primary school also have a jewel hidden in the fragrant air, small quiet, peaceful, beautiful.
My study career, was spent in the primary school.
Primary school students in the reading in the village of, that be the dajing years into a temple, dao, ornamental engraving doors and Windows, quite some history, liberation to do a primary school in our village.
After many years of a summer evening, swift will be sent bray a bit bleak, on the stele of crashing the piece of mind, I know the history of the primary school of the humble, but before that we don't know.
So big a deep courtyard, rustic houses, soil and the walls of a few, mottled broken, a school was quiet, the qu jing are silent.
A snow pear tree under the south wall drive too hard to absolutely brilliant, very narcissistic.
Teacher surnamed white lived in a hut near the snow pear, remember that when his hair was white, tall, wide edge add a thick glasses, who looks more vulgar.
White teacher is amiable, the children are not afraid of him.
There is a small story on this, our village has a naughty child, specially love tree on the wall, play dates to pick apricot.
One day he saw on campus that hawthorn fruit branches, red, and over the wall to steal.
After hu chew disorderly chew up, and I call the distant companion: "white teacher isn't in."
Coincided with a white teacher walked out of the door, should be 1: "who said I didn't in?"
Puck spooked, roll and climb to slip under the tree, the white teacher can ask hurt no, the child thus break was actually wrong.
Many years later, when I became a teacher, on the way home, I often see the figure of white teacher, the old man was driving the few sheep grazing.
Why, I don't have the courage to ask, or even didn't even have the courage to say hello, feel full of sad.
In addition to white teacher for home far live school, other teachers are mostly our namesake, this is a dilemma to us, I do not know the brother uncle or a teacher.
Such as my uncle is in school, but his sister a few particularly severe for us.
Upgrade, grade 2, I test scores are seven or eight, but the teacher in charge teacher zhang didn't sign the notice of my parents, it let me worry about a holiday.
In today's score is everything, I had not heard of any student test scores and was failing grades for misbehave, but at that time we have, people to see a person's quality is also very important.
From the quality education today, they do that is right.
In the primary school is relatively closed and backward, rural children the stubborn and intolerance of self-esteem makes us at the age of the girls maintained a hostility from the bottom of my heart, no one dare to have a favorable to a girl.
My niece has a height ma punched me in the classroom, but I did not mocked by others.
In our eyes, really humbling thing is hanging out with a female classmate.
Of course, we also often make some prank, bully female classmates.
Just because of this, the holiday I uneasy, but my father doesn't care about, the boys.
After school, after I repeatedly to admit my mistake, I finally a level up.
Actually when I also didn't go to school, I was already a fixture in primary school.
This story because my uncle teach in a school, two of my elder sister also in school, but also because the school is near my home.
My brother and I all day long walking on campus, to play in the shade, here, we are the best enlightenment education.
Lang lang's top fly around our ears, when we really reading, we can carry on the back of small articles and poems to calculus math has a lot.
To be honest, I'm not a very smart man, but by the good atmosphere after gave me great encouragement, made me think about it won't stop learning, persistence makes me have been read to the university.
Vaguely remember primary school as a symbol of mourning hall, when the white flowers round the door, crying.
That was a memorable day, let a person life when chairman MAO died after the news to our village, the whole village was in the primary stage of the south courtyard on festivals, our village people together, arm around black veil, silently.
One of my aunt cried sad sad.
I have never seen a person will cry for a physical body to the injury, and our village is in such a simple way off our great leader, I think, chairman MAO, it really live in the ordinary heart.
Probably is destroyed when stealing eat apricot branches;
Or climb column broke the carve patterns or designs on woodwork building.
In a word, I said goodbye to the elementary school soon, a junior high school to another school, it is also a primary school, the deepest impression is that it has a broken ancient city wall.
At dusk, the sunset like blood, swift, we sat on the walls, the wind lifted our hair, clothes, took our excitement and publicity to further and further.
At that moment, I suddenly felt the tranquility of the primary school, poignant, their simplicity, not job make public, but contained so many beautiful children's dream.
Yes, every child has a primary school in the heart, it is their dream the place to start.
